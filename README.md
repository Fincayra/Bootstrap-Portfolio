# Bootstrap-Portfolio
My portfolio project built using Bootstrap css 12/4/19

1. Due to family activites and the general hustle and bustle of the holidays, I was only able to apply the bootstrap nav bar, columns and rows, and media queries to the 'About Me' page of my portfolio. Very sorry!

2. For some reason, the bootstrap nav bar's dropdown menu was never able to function and I copy pasted it exactly as it was on the website. I also couldn't manage to customize the background color, link colors, or anything else without losing the hamburger button in the smaller resolutions and all of my links on the left side of the bar. I think my CSS was somehow clashing with bootstrap's CSS.

3. In the smaller media query resolutions, I wasn't able to align the ul lists in a horizontal row in smaller font like I wanted to. Not sure where I went wrong there, but I left a comment on the style1 CSS page itself.
